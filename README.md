# ðŸ§  Autism Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the possibility of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning algorithms based on input features collected through a standard autism screening dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- âœ… Built a machine learning model to predict autism based on questionnaire data
- âœ… Used Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib
- âœ… Used ml alorithms like Naive Bayes, K-means Clustering and more
- âœ… Jupyter Notebook used for development and visualization
